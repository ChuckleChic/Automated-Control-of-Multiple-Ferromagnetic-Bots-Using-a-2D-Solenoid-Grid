# Automated Control of Multiple Ferromagnetic Bots Using a 2D Solenoid Grid

##  Overview
This repository contains the detailed report of an 8-week research internship conducted at the **M2D2 Lab, IISc Bengaluru**, focused on developing an **autonomous control system** for multiple ferromagnetic bots using a 2D solenoid grid.

The system replaces manual coil activation with a vision-based, automated control mechanism using **Python algorithms**, **Arduino microcontrollers**, and **camera-based tracking**. This setup enables coordinated tasks like **shape transformation**, **navigation through obstacles**, and **object manipulation**.

##  Problem Statement
Global magnetic field-based control systems fail to provide independent control over individual bots. This project aims to overcome that challenge by:
- Automating the control of bots using **localized solenoids**.
- Designing **vision-based algorithms** for path planning.
- Implementing **real-time coil activation** using serial communication with Arduino.

---

##  Experimental Setup
- A **grid of solenoids** generates localized magnetic fields.
- Overhead **camera system** tracks bots in real-time.
- Bots consist of **ferromagnetic balls** in spring-loaded holders with **Teflon feet** for smooth movement.
- An **automatic braking system** enables precise control by using friction.
